Known Bugs:

-Doesn't Work on Mac - date edit is mm/dd/yy instead of mm/dd/yyyy and causes problems
-Editing an item doesnt set the Category to what the orginial Category was by default. The user needs to change it to what it was (Was working but broke after updating the backend)

Clarifications If Concerned:

-List is Sorted via Unicode so AA before aa, and NN > aa. If sorting doesnt seem to be working it may just be the casing of the Category
